# design-patterns

You are coding up the back-end for a Package Handling system.
Another team is creating a front-end part, but this is not ready yet. Yet another team is working on a persistence layer which, will be able to generate unique Shipment ID's for you when needed (see below), but this is also not yet ready.

You will need, at minimum, two objects. One will represent the controlling, or Client object that will interact with the front-end, when it is available. The other will represent the object being shipped.
